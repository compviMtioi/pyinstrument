Some players may wonder why xlive.dll is needed for these games in the first place. Xlive.dll is part of the Games for Windows - LIVE service, which provides online features such as multiplayer, achievements, chat, and cloud saves for some PC games. However, the service has been discontinued by Microsoft since 2014, and many games have switched to other platforms such as Steam or Origin. Therefore, xlive.dll may not be necessary for some newer games or updated versions of older games.
 
If you want to play Battlevschess or other Games for Windows - LIVE games without xlive.dll, you may need to download and install a mod or a patch that bypasses the service. However, this may affect the game's functionality or performance, and you may lose some online features. You should also be careful about the source of the mod or patch, as some may contain malware or viruses. Always scan any files you download with a reliable antivirus program before installing them.
