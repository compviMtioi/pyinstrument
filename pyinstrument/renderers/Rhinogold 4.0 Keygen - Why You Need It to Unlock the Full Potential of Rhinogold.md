# What is RhinoGold 4.0 and How to Use It for Jewelry Design?
 
RhinoGold 4.0 is a specific jewelry program designed by jewelers for jewelers[^1^]. It is based on Rhino 3D, a powerful and versatile modeling software that can create any shape imaginable[^2^]. RhinoGold 4.0 adds a number of features and tools that are tailored for jewelry design, such as gems, settings, shanks, bezels, prongs, engraving, texturing, rendering and more.
 
With RhinoGold 4.0, you can create stunning jewelry designs from scratch or use the built-in library of components and styles. You can also import and edit existing models from other formats, such as STL, OBJ, 3DM and others. You can customize every aspect of your design, from the size and shape of the gems, to the type and color of the metal, to the level of detail and realism. You can also preview your design in different lighting and backgrounds, and generate high-quality images and videos for presentation or marketing purposes.

RhinoGold 4.0 also helps you prepare your design for manufacturing, whether you want to print it in 3D or send it to a casting service. You can use the STL Wizard to optimize your model for printing, check for errors and defects, hollow it out to save material and weight, add supports and sprues, and export it as an STL file[^3^]. You can also use the Support tool to add pins and bars to your model for casting[^4^]. You can also organize your models by layers, colors, names and materials[^3^].
 
If you want to learn how to use RhinoGold 4.0 for jewelry design, you can watch the online tutorials on YouTube[^3^] [^4^], or enroll in a training course offered by TDM Solutions SL, the developer of RhinoGold[^1^].

You can also experiment with different shapes, colors, textures and effects, and see how they look on your model. You can also use the Animation tool to create dynamic and interactive videos of your design, or the Clayoo tool to sculpt organic and freeform shapes.
